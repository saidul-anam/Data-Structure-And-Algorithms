1)array.cpp

This file contains basically array based implementation.It consists of all the required file for the tasks given .this file doesn't contain any main function.

2)list.cpp

This file contains basically linked list based implementation.The implementation that were written in this file is in single link list.It consists of all the required file for the tasks given .this file doesn't contain any main function.

3)task_1.cpp

this file has the array.cpp and list.cpp file as a header file.the 10 function given in task_1 is implemented here.it has a main function.main function call those function according to the user input and show the output in every input for those function.for the current position i started with 1 ex:
if a array index is 0 and its the current position it will show current position 1 as current position starts from 1.

4)task_2.cpp

this file has the array.cpp and list.cpp file as a header file.the 3 function given in task_2 is implemented here.it has a main function.Main function call those function according to the user input and show the output in every input for those function.

5)task_3.cpp
this file also contains array.cpp and list.cpp as a header file.However in this implementation, input was taken like this way:
10 ------------this means number of cars.
4--------------number of garage
4--------------garage maximum element
2 3 3 10 7-----(garage number) (number of cars are in garage) (based on number of cars are 
                  in garage, takes input for the garage) 
1 4 1 2 4 8
3 0
4 3 6 5 9

ret 8
